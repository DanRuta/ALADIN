# ALADIN

ALADIN style representation model from the ALADIN/StyleBabel papers

This repo contains the inference code and model weights (releases) for the ViT variant of the ALADIN style representation model, first described in the *ALADIN: All Layer Adaptive Instance Normalization for Fine-grained Style Similarity* paper [1], and evolved with the ViT backbone in the *StyleBabel: Artistic Style Tagging and Captioning* paper [2].

The model weights can be downloaded from the releases tab of this repo. Download and extract that `aladinVIT_bamfg_64.47.pt` file next to the scripts, to use it. These are weights trained over the BAM-FG dataset [1], with an accuracy of 64.47% over its test set, as described in [2].

# In this repo

The `main.py` file contains a minimal runnable example for inference using ALADIN-ViT. It loads the `test.jpg` image and prints its style embedding.

The `cluster_search.py` file contains a more complex example, where ALADIN style codes are extracted for a dataset of images, clustered (k=100) with faiss, and then image retrieval is executed with each centroid as a query, for the top 10 most stylistically similar images.
